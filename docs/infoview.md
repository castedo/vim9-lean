InfoView
========

The *location list* window in Vim roughly corresponds to the *InfoView* feature of the
[Lean 4 VS Code extension](https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean4/blob/master/vscode-lean4/manual/manual.md).

Using the Vim `:lopen` (or `:lop`) command will open the location list window,
which contains diagnostic messages generated by Lean.
These diagnostic messages from Lean contain some of the information found in InfoView,
but in a much less user-friendly format, as you'd expect in Vim.

For more details, see Vim `:help location-list` and `:help lsp.txt`.


Tips & Tricks
-------------

If you want a diagnostic message that indicates whether a theorem `somethingIsStuff` is
proven,
you can add the following line:
```
#print axioms somethingIsStuff
```
If the theorem does not depend on the axiom `sorryAx`, then the proof goal has been
accomplished. For example:
```
theorem vimGreaterThanEmacs: True := trivial
#print axioms vimGreaterThanEmacs
```
generates the diagnostic message:
```
truth.lean|2 col 1-7 info| 'vimGreaterThanEmacs' does not depend on any axioms
```
so we can see the statement is true, obviously.
