Vim key mappings for LSP features
=================================

The `lsp` and `vim9-lean` plugin packages do not maintain key mappings for LSP commands.

This documentation provides a starter Vim script with key mappings for LSP
features. These key mappings are optional, and you may prefer to use different key mappings.

Copy [lsp-key-mappings.vim](lsp-key-mappings.vim) to `~/.config/vim/plugin/`.
You will need to maintain this copy as your own key mapping configuration file.
