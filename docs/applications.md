Applications
============

This page lists some applications that are not editors but can run alongside
an editor when writing in the Lean language.

Many users enjoy the simplicity of writing code in a single software application:
an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). However, since as early as 1990, computer users
have been able to
run multiple software applications simultaneously in separate windows, thanks to the
magic of [operating system multitasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking).


Lean-specific non-editor applications
-------------------------------------

### Lean-TUI

Lean-TUI is a terminal-only (TUI) interactive proof explorer
that responds to your cursor position in any editor with LSP support.
It is comparable to the InfoView in the
[Lean 4 VS Code extension](https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean4/blob/master/vscode-lean4/manual/manual.md).

!!! danger
    Lean-TUI is an early-release, experimental prototype under development.
